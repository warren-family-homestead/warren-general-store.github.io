## Warren General Store

The Warren General Store is an old country store located in Prospect Hill, NC. It was built in the mid-1800s and is still owned by the Warren family. It has since been a general store, housed the local Post Office, and served as the office for an interior design company. Today it is kept as a historical landmark to both Prospect Hill and the Warren family.
